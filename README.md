# Master's Thesis: Computational Tool for Quantifying Movement Patterns: Linking Neural Activity to behavior

## ðŸ“œ Overview

This repository contains some of the code and documentation associated with my Master's thesis titled **"Computational Tool for Quantifying Movement Patterns: Linking Neural Activity to behavior"**, completed at Copenhagen University (KU) in the Neural Circuitries and Motor Repair Laboratory, 2025.

The research focuses on linking neural activity to behavior through mechanics and computational methods. It aims to develope a software that can accurately identify and quantify automatically specific behavioral patterns using various datasets, testing its ability to analyze different functional tasks.

Understanding the neural basis of behavior is crucial to unraveling how the brain controls physiological and pathological processes. Motion capture, coupled with kinematic analysis, allows for precise tracking and quantification of animal movement, providing insights into the neural circuits that govern behavior. By observing detailed motor patterns such as gait, researchers can infer how underlying neural dynamics are altered in different health states. Mice, due to their genetic and physiological similarity to humans, serve as an excellent model for these studies.

## ðŸ“– Abstract

There is a critical need for quantification tools in neuroscience that accurately link behavior with neural activity. This project aims to develop software that, using motion capture data, automatically identifies and quantifies mouse movement patterns, such as gait. Differences between healthy and pathological states will be quantified with kinematic analysis and assessed through machine learning methods. Validation through pain studies will offer insights into neural dysfunction. Ultimately, this tool will help translate preclinical findings to clinical settings, enhancing diagnosis and monitoring of behavioral patterns in neurological disorders.
